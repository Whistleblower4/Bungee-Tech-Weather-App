# Bungee-Tech-Weather-App
This is an assignment given to me by Bungee Technology. The app includes the usage of Open Weather API to show the detailed weather information in a user friendly fully flexible UI. Main languages that I have used while building this application is HTML, JavaScript and CSS.

# How to setup and run application locally:
1. Download all the necessary files in the repository. files include: index.html, config.js, script.js and style.css and include them in a folder.
2. Use VScode to open the project folder, where you will see the file directory.
3. Before starting the application on the local host, the application will require an API key to run the code. This API key will be made available through email.
4. After obtaining the API key, open the config.js file and paste the api key between the double quotes. Note that there should not be any space between the API key. Double cross check the API key and save the file.
5. Open the terminal and type this command: start index.html. Alternatively, you can also go to the folder and right click on the file (index.html) and click on open in browser.
6. The application will start running. 

# Introduction to the project:
Ever wondered what the weather is like before stepping outside? The Weather App has you covered! This sleek and easy-to-use web application delivers real-time weather updates, air quality insights, and a five-day forecast for any location worldwide.

Why You'll Love It ðŸš€
Instant Weather Updates â€“ Get live weather data for any city. Get the current temperature and the weather (Sunny, Rainy, Cloudy and so on)

Find My Location â€“ Let the app detect your location automatically. Click on Current Location button to give access to your current location. 

Air Quality Insights â€“ Know what you're breathing and get review on a scale from 1 to 5: (Good, Fair, Moderate, Poor, Very Poor) with real-time AQI data, extracting all the data from openWeather like: PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, NO, NO2, O3.

Know what time is sunrise and sunset based upon the weather a city is facing. 

Know your environment: Humidity, Air Pressure, Visibility, Wind Speed and what it feels like rather then current temperature.

Hourly Forecast â€“ Stay ahead of sudden weather changes. shows weather as per timings throughout the day.

Five-Day Forecast â€“ Plan your week with confidence. 

Powered by HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API to provide accurate and up-to-date weather information. Plus, I have prioritized security by keeping API keys safe, ensuring a smooth and secure experience.

Fully flexible and responsive website leveraging custom grid features. Build for all sizes of screens: 1100px, 1040px, 992px, 850px, 660px, 580px, 520px, 480px, 450px and 380px. 

This app uses font awesome for all the fonts, UNPKG for icons and openweather for weather forecasts and Air pollution indices.

# Technologies used:
1. Languages / Framework used: The main languages used for this website are: HTML, CSS and vanilla javaScript. No library or framework is used during this project to keep the code readable, debuggable and simpler to evaluate.
2. API used: This project used openWeather API for extracting all the necessary data and showcasing them to the frontend.

# Prerequisites and dependencies:
The code is fairly simple and doesn't need user to download anything, rather then Visual Studio Code. 
Prerequisites: Do not run the application without mentioning the API key in the config file. After writing API key, save the file and then run it on google chrome or microsoft edge.
